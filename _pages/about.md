I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Oxford. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed an MPhil in Economics at the University of Oxford and a BBA in Economics & Finance at St. Francis Xavier University. My research interests are in environmental economics, opinion formation, spatial econometrics, and wine economics.
