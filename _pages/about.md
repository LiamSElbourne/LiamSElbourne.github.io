I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Oxford. As part of the departmentâ€™s Resource and Environment research group, my doctoral thesis focuses on how public perceptions of climate change are shaped and their implications for pro-environmental behaviour. This research is supervised by Dr Elizabeth Baldwin and Dr Steve Bond. 

More broadly, my research interests lie in environmental economics, economic history, public opinion, and the economics of wine.
